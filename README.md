# [Holla if ya hear me](https://holla-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) - Streamlit Edition

![Holla if ya hear me logo](./holla.png)

#### Project status - Complete


## Introduction

A fun [web application](https://holla-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) that creates hot takes regarding the relative coolness of various musicians and bands. This is a re-build of my [previous Flask web app](https://github.com/thecraigd/holla) using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io).

A [friend of mine](https://steveothecripplingaddictions.bandcamp.com/) has been making facebook posts for the last month or so, where he makes a controversial statement of the format:

"*Artist generally considered not to be that cool* is cooler than *artist generally considered to be pretty cool*. Holla if ya hear me."

I had varying reactions to these posts depending on their content, but in general I found them enjoyable. I decided to build a web application which would automate this kind of post.


### Technologies used
* [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io)
